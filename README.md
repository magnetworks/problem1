Video Player Problem\
Give: A video file and the frames [jpg images] extracted from it.

Build a video player and frame/image anotation tool. The web browser based tool should allow one to select a video file, play/pause/rewind/fwd the video. 
When the video player is paused, the corresponding frame of the video should be opened in a frame analysis box where the user can zoom/scroll in the image. The user would also like to draw either a box or draw with pencil or write a text on the frame and store it as a new image. You can implement any of the annotation methods - pencil/box or text as convenient.

You may use any JavaScript libraries or pre-existing frameworks you like
